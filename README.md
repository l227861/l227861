Hi, I’m Azwa Nawaz 👋

I’m a cross-platform developer who loves building beautiful, intuitive, and user-focused applications.

I work with Flutter, React, Java, and modern backend tools, but my real passion lies in clean UI, smooth user flow, and elegant product design. I enjoy turning ideas into polished digital experiences—whether they're mobile apps, web platforms, or desktop tools.

🎨 UI/UX-Focused Developer

I prioritize design, usability, and seamless interfaces. My work often involves:

Building interactive and responsive UIs

Crafting consistent design systems

Ensuring smooth navigation, accessibility, and user flow

Turning concepts into production-ready, visually appealing apps

Collaborating on app branding, layout, and visual hierarchy

Whether I'm designing mobile screens or website layouts, I aim to create experiences that feel natural and delightful.

💼 Professional & Freelance Experience

Alongside my academic and project work, I contribute as a partner on selective freelance projects.
